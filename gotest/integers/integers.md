Testing and writing code is slow but its the best practice. TDD has great advantages i think particular no gibberish code is left out. 

## Example functions in GO. 

Go language has examples which are compiled but can be executed optionally. one of the wierdiest thing about Go Examples are the function should have a comment in order to execute which is absolutely ridiculos at first but then things start to make sense when you start to write complex programs with those examples. 

To see if the function has been tested or not you need to add -v flag to go test 

> `go test -v`

Rest of the things are same. 

see you in the next chapter.
