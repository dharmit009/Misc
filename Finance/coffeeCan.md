# Coffee Can Method: 
# Pareto Principle: 

The 80 percent of your returns comes from the 20 percent of your investment 

Examples: meaning let's say you invested in 5 Good companies. You might have lossed all the money in 4 of the companies but there will be one company which will have a very good amount of return. Which will not only pay for all the loss but will also give you great profit in long term. 

* Note: Here i say that you might loose money in 4 of the companies which might not be the case if you have done your research 
properly which buying any assest. 

# Rules: 

1. Bought and forget your investment. 
1. Long Term. 

# Advantages: 

1. No Fees.
1. No need to track the market.
1. Low odds of Negative return. 

* Low odds of Negative return: 
		Sensex chart shows that if you hold it for one day there is 50% chance that you may earn returns. 
		But if you have hold Sensex stock for more than one year then there is 68% chance that you may earn some returns.
		If you have hold Sensex for more than 7 years than you have never lost money as Sensex has 30 companies in them. (Guarranted Investment).

# Disadvantages: 

1. Right way to invest is to check for future cash flow of a company. 
1. Intial startup companies are left out. 

# Things to look for: 

1. Revenue Growth (Minimum: 10% for last 7 to 10 years). 
1. Return on Capital Employed (Should be always greater than 15% each year for last 5/10 years) [checks for both debt and equity].
1. Return of Equity (Should be always greater than 15% each year for last 5/10 years).

If ROE and ROCE are close then the company is one of the best for investment. 

Formula: 
```
>> Return on capital Employed [ ROCE ] = Earning Before Interest and Taxes / Capital employed;  // In Percentage. 
>> Return of Equity [ ROE ] = Net Income / Shareholder's Equity;  // In Percentage. 
>> Total asset - LiabilityOfCompany = shareHolders equity;
```
