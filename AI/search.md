| Agent              | Entity that perceives its environment and acts on it.                             |
| State              | A configuration of the agent in it's environment                                  |
| Initial Stage      | The state in which the agent begins.                                              |
| Actions            | Choices that can made in a state.                                                 |
| Transitional Model | A description of state results got by performing actions.                         |
| State Space        | The set of all states reachable from the initial state by any squence of actions. |
| Goal Test          | A way to determine whether a given state is a goal state.                         |
| Path Cost          | A numerical cost associated with a given path                                     |
| Solution           | A sequence of actions that leads from the initial state to the goal state.        |
| Optimal Solution   | A solution that causes the lowest path cost among all solution.                   |
